# trapperkeeper

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Usage

FIXME

### Configuration
Trapperkeeper accepts a ```--config``` command-line argument.  This argument is used to specify the configuration file for the application.  The format is a ```.ini``` file.  Alternatively, the ```--config``` argument can be used to specify a directory of .ini files.

Trapperkeeper looks for specific things in this configuration.  Logging is configured like this:
```INI
[global]
logging-config = /path/to/log4j.properties
```


## Using Our Test Utils

Trapperkeeper provides [utility code](./test/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper/testutils) for use in tests.
The code is available in a separate "test" jar that you may depend on by using a classifier in your project dependencies.

```clojure
  (defproject yourproject "1.0.0"
    ...
    :profiles {:test {:dependencies [[puppetlabs/trapperkeeper "x.y.z" :classifier "test"]]}})
```
