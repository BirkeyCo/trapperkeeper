# trapperkeeper

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

### Implementation Questions
* Life cycle for startup? Or just expect services to start during graph compile?
  - Use atoms for implementation?
* How to handle command-line args?
  - Force services to provide required/supported CLI args?
  - Use protocols? Or require additional functions in graphs?
  - How to resolve conflicts in service CLI args?
* Use with-redefs for common functions?
